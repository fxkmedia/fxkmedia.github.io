## Did You Know Disney's Hollywood Studios Wasn't Always What It Is Today?
From its inception as a combined theme park and operating production studio, Disney's Hollywood Studios has undergone significant transformations. Originally opened on May 1, 1989, as Disney-MGM Studios, the park was designed to immerse visitors in the glamour of Hollywood filmmaking, featuring real backlots and production facilities inspired by the golden age of movies.

### Early Years: The Studio and Light, Camera, Action!
Disney entered a licensing agreement with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1985, which allowed them to use the MGM name and branding. This collaboration aimed to create a park that would serve not only as an entertainment destination but also as a functional movie production hub. The park's first attractions were the **Great Movie Ride** and the **Studio Backlot Tour**, allowing guests to experience movie magic firsthand. 

The initial concept included a working animation studio, which played a pivotal role in Disney's Renaissance era. Films like *Roger Rabbit*, *Lion King*, and *Lilo & Stitch* benefited from the studio's presence. However, production facilities gradually ceased to operate, marking a shift away from studio operations towards themed experiences.

### Expansion and Transformation
In 1994, the park expanded with the addition of **Sunset Boulevard**, which featured famous attractions like **The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror** and **Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith**. Despite this growth, the production aspects began to fade, especially after the MGM branding was removed in 2008. The park was officially renamed **Disney's Hollywood Studios**, signaling a broader focus on movie themes beyond MGM.

### Modern Era: Immersive Storytelling
Today, Disney's Hollywood Studios is known for its immersive lands like **Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge** and **Toy Story Land**. Attractions such as **Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway** have replaced older classics, offering guests newer, interactive experiences. The park continues to evolve, reflecting a broader vision of Hollywood than ever imagined, keeping Walt Disney's legacy of blending illusion and reality alive.
