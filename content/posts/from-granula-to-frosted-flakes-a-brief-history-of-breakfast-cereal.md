**From Granula to Frosted Flakes: A Brief History of Breakfast Cereal**
=====================================================================================

Breakfast cereal has become an indispensable part of many people's morning routines worldwide. From its humble beginnings to its modern-day proliferation in various sweet and healthy forms, the history of breakfast cereal is fascinating and rich with influential figures and inventions. Here's a journey through its evolution:

## Early Beginnings: Granula and the Advent of Cold Cereal

The story of breakfast cereal begins in the mid-19th century with James Caleb Jackson, a health enthusiast who operated a medical sanitarium called Our Home on the Hillside in Dansville, New York. In 1863, Jackson introduced **Granula**, the first cold breakfast cereal. Made from graham flour dough, it was baked into a hard sheet, broken into small pieces, and required soaking overnight to become edible[3][4]. Although Granula never gained widespread popularity due to its toughness and the need for preparation, it laid the foundation for future cereal developments.

## The Rise of Kellogg and Post

In the late 1800s, John Harvey Kellogg, a physician and Seventh-day Adventist, was pioneering health reforms at the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan. Like Jackson, Kellogg explored vegetarian dietary options to improve digestion. He developed a version of granola (which was initially referred to as granula) to help his patients maintain healthy bowel movements[3][4].

Kellogg's brother, Will Keith Kellogg, played a crucial role in commercializing cereal. Together, they experimented with a baked mixture of flour, oats, and cornmeal. When a batch of wheat dough became fermented and flaky, Will discovered that by baking these flakes, they could be packaged and sold as a more convenient and mass-produced cereal[5].

### Corn Flakes: The Turning Point

In **1906**, after replacing wheat with corn, **Corn Flakes** were born. This marked a significant moment in cereal history as they were more palatable and could be mass-produced with added sugar to appeal to a broader audience[5]. Will Kellogg's decision to add sugar and his innovative marketing strategies, including the inclusion of prizes in cereal boxes, catapulted Kellogg's into the forefront of the cereal industry.

## C.W. Post and Grape-Nuts

Around the same time, C.W. Post, a former patient at Kellogg's sanitarium, was inspired to create his own cereal products. In **1897**, he introduced **Grape-Nuts**, a crunchy breakfast cereal made from flour, salt, and yeast, which quickly gained popularity[1][2]. Post's innovative marketing and quality products also contributed significantly to the growth of the cereal industry.

## Expansion and Diversification

The early 20th century saw significant advancements in cereal technology and marketing. The Quaker Oats Company introduced **Puffed Wheat and Puffed Rice** by forcing grain to explode under pressure, creating lighter and more pleasant textures[3][4]. Later, General Mills launched **Cheerios** in **1941**, a cereal that embodied simplicity and ease, becoming a staple in many households[3][4].

### Post-WWII and the Rise of Children's Cereals

After World War II, cereal consumption surged, evolving to target children with cartoon characters and prizes. **Tony the Tiger** and **Frosted Flakes** are iconic examples of this shift, making breakfast cereal a dominant breakfast choice around the world[3][5].

## Modern Developments

Today, the cereal industry continues to evolve, balancing between offering traditional sweet cereals and those catering to the "health food movement" with organic and whole-grain options. Brands like Kashi and Barbara's Bakery have emerged, reflecting consumer preferences for more natural ingredients[5].

In conclusion, from its beginnings with Granula to the array of choices available now, breakfast cereal has evolved into a colorful and versatile breakfast staple that has captured hearts and stomachs globally.
